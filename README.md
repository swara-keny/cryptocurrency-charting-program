# Crytocurrency Charting Program

Following libraries are required to run the program: matplotlib, numpy, pandas, mplfinance, tkinter

A public github project "Tvdatafeed" is also required. Link: https://github.com/dewkul/tvDatafeed

This repository contains an interactive cryptocurrency analysis application built in Python using Tkinter for the GUI and Matplotlib for data visualization. The application allows users to visualize real-time price data for various cryptocurrencies with advanced technical analysis tools.

# Key Features:

User-Friendly Interface: Navigate seamlessly through different sections with a multi-frame setup built using Tkinter.

Real-Time Data Visualization: Display candlestick charts of cryptocurrency prices across multiple timeframes (1 min, 5 min, hourly, daily, weekly).

Technical Analysis Tools: Perform deeper analysis using popular indicators such as MACD, RSI, and moving averages.

Search Functionality: Easily find and display price data of different cryptocurrencies from multiple exchanges.

Hands-On Experience: Demonstrates the use of real-time data handling and user interaction in financial applications.

There are still many features in this GUI that might not be proper.



# Objectives
• Stock Selection: Provide a dropdown menu or search functionality to allow users to select
their desired cryptocurrency (e.g., BTCUSD) for analysis.

• Providing different timeframes: Explore the distribution of cryptocurrency prices over different time intervals
(e.g., daily, weekly, monthly)

• Toolbar: Integrate a navigation toolbar with options for changing graph size.

• Techincal Indicators :Use of technical indicators analyze past price and volume data to help predict future 
market movements in trading and investing

• Graph Visualization: Utilize Matplotlib and FigureCanvasTkAgg to render interactive graphs and charts within the application's GUI, and ensuring real-time updates and dynamic visualization.
